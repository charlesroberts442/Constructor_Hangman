Constructor_Hangman is a command line interface version of the hangman game.

The phrases to guess are all musical artists.

You will be prompted to guess letters in the name of the musical artists, and whether you've won or lost the game.

After a game completes, you will be prompted to say if you want to play another round of hangman.

Good luck, and have fun!!
